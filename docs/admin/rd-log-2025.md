# R&D Log 2025 Seqlok

## 2025-11-25 (5h)

[hotswap, concurrency] 3h
Refined the seqlock-backed SwapTicket state machine and tightened
the conformance tests around version wraparound and ABA-style races.

[arch, monorepo, tooling] 2h
Scaffolded the layered workspace (base/primitives/introspect/core/commands/
hotswap/integration/playground). Wired per-package tsconfig, ESLint, and Vitest
so each layer can lint and test in isolation.

## 2025-11-26 (5h)

[errors, design] 2.5h
First serious attempt at splitting the error system out of core. Explored
domain IDs, ownership per package, and how a global registry could aggregate
without centralizing everything again.

[tooling, types] 1.5h
Experimented with workspace tsconfig setup, project references, and type-only
test commands. Learned what breaks when core pulls in base-style helpers.

[diagnostics, introspect] 1h
Started shaping the idea of an observability sidecar (future introspect package)
and how it could consume errors and counters without polluting core.

## 2025-11-27 (6.5h)

[errors, registry] 3h
Pushed on distributed error domains: split out internal/spec/plan/backing/
binding/handoff env-style domains conceptually and designed how a numeric
registry could be aggregated from multiple packages.

[introspect, architecture] 2h
Clarified the role of an introspect layer vs core: counters, sessions, health
views, registry export. Sketched how ALL_DOMAINS and error schema export might
work as a separate package.

[tests, stability] 1.5h
Kept core tests green while changing the error shapes. Ran through binding/
backing/spec tests to make sure behavior was still unchanged despite refactors.

## 2025-11-28 (6.5h)

[monorepo, extraction] 3h
Started the actual extraction of base/primitives/introspect from core. Moved
type helpers and low-level primitives into their new homes and adjusted imports
to respect the layering.

[errors, health] 2h
Iterated on error domain definitions and health interpretation. Designed how
health should sit on top of ErrorMeta without coupling to any specific package
or registry layout.

[docs, planning] 1.5h
Updated architecture notes and planning docs around error domains, introspect,
and package layering. Aligned the v1.0 story with the new monorepo shape.

## 2025-11-29 (7.5h)

[errors, base, primitives, introspect] 3.5h
Completed the split of the error system into @seqlok/base, @seqlok/primitives,
and @seqlok/introspect. Wired core to consume the new domains, fixed imports,
and kept tests and type checks passing.

[health, diagnostics] 2h
Moved health helpers into base as a portable lens over ErrorMeta. Finished
ALL_DOMAINS aggregation, numeric code mapping, registry export helpers, and
runWithIntrospect wiring on top of the new layout.

[tooling, perf, docs] 2h
Hooked up strip-extra-dts and shared Vitest config across packages, re-ran
benches and refreshed generated bench docs. Updated Status Matrix, Package
Readiness, Gravity Well, and this R&D log to reflect the new reality.

## 2025-11-30 (7h)

[errors, numeric codes] 3h
Locked down the numeric error-code scheme (8-bit domain ID + 24-bit local
ordinal) and the DOMAIN_IDS map. Split domain ownership cleanly across
packages (env, backing, primitives, binding, handoff, introspect, commands,
hotswap) and wired domain builders in @seqlok/base so each package owns
its registry locally.

[introspect, registry aggregation] 2.5h
Built the cross-package registry aggregation in @seqlok/introspect:
ALL_DOMAINS, the registry map, and JSON export helpers. Sketched subset
selection (domains, codes, severities) and the first version of the
error-registry export format for external tooling.

[docs, governance] 1.5h
Drafted architecture docs for the new error system and its governance rules:
how domains map to packages, why numeric codes are append-only, and how
external consumers should treat the registry and schema over time.

## 2025-12-01 (7h)

[tooling, dev workflow] 3h
Simplified the root CLI scripts: added `pnpm verify` (clean + build + check),
centralized `check` (typecheck + tests + lint), and made sure each workspace
package exposes a consistent script surface (build, clean, test, test:types,
lint, bench where relevant).

[build, tsconfig, Vite] 2h
Fixed Vite builds that were failing to resolve `@seqlok/base` by introducing
`scripts/vite/vite.base.config.ts` with workspace aliases and externals.
Updated @seqlok/core and @seqlok/hotswap to use the shared helper. Tidied
tsconfig layering with `tsconfig.workspace.json`, per-package `tsconfig.json`
(excluding docs/bench/dist), and `tsconfig.eslint.json` for ESLint.

[docs, onboarding] 2h
Wrote `docs/DEVELOPER-CLI.md` to document dev/dev:ui/verify/check flows,
package-local workflows, and common troubleshooting steps. Linked it from
the root README and package docs. Trimmed older Gravity Well quickstart and
draft docs that no longer match the current workspace and error layout.

## 2025-12-02 (5h)

[introspect, registry & tests] 2h
Finalized the error registry tooling in @seqlok/introspect: added
`descriptors.ts` and `export-errors.ts`, tightened the JSON schema for the
registry (locked `schemaVersion` and `generator` via singleton enums and
enforced strict shapes for `domainIds` and stats), and introduced
`domains.aggregation.test.ts` and `error-index-invariants.test.ts` to guard
prefix uniqueness, domainId mapping, and numeric-code invariants. Removed the
obsolete manifest snapshot test and its generator script.

[tooling, pipeline hygiene] 1.5h
Ran the full `pnpm verify` pipeline (clean + build + check) repeatedly and
fixed edge cases around Vite/Rollup configs, strip-extra-dts behavior, and
ESLint coverage so docs and tests are linted via consistent
`tsconfig.eslint.json` setups in each package.

[branches, planning] 1.5h
Merged `feat/error-system-split` into `feat/v0.3.0-hotswap`, then merged
hotswap forward into `dev` so the new error system becomes the baseline.
Updated the top-level README and architecture wording to emphasize Seqlok as
a generic real-time substrate rather than a single-client solution, and lined
up the next commands/hotswap work on top of the cleaned-up dev branch.

## 2025-12-03 (7h)

[playground, hotswap UI] 3.5h
Refined the Hotswap Lab Vue playground into a proper three-panel layout
(Config panel, Progress viewport, Inspector). Extracted `HotswapViewport`,
`HotswapConfigPanel`, and `HotswapInspector` components and wired them against
the composable. Added zoom + follow controls, improved phase band rendering,
added an overview minimap with loop/step transport controls, and polished the
A/B engine markers so the swap feels like a proper deck timeline.

[perf, scroll/animation] 2h
Profiled the viewport with Chrome DevTools and hunted down layout thrash and
forced reflows. Introduced cached geometry for the scroll container,
rAF-throttled scroll handlers, and pointer-based scrubbing that auto-scrolls
near edges. Switched playback from frame-based stepping to a time-based rAF
loop, so GC / UI stalls no longer cause visible pauses in the swap animation.

[ghost DJ, data model & AI arch] 1.5h
Drafted `ghost-dj-data-model.md` to formalize the session logging and state
representation for Ghost DJ: track features, timeline event schema, and the
state/action view over a session. Explored how large-context cloud models
(Gemini-style) fit into the architecture as an offline/nearline policy planner,
with Seqlok providing the hard real-time execution layer via scheduled
commands.

## 2025-12-04 (4h)

[docs, alignment] 1.5h
Re-aligned the core documentation with the current Seqlok codebase. Rewrote the
Seqlok Primer to match the layered package layout and the final canonical flow,
removed or collapsed outdated planning/DoD/critical-path matrices, and trimmed
the Gravity Well docs down to a small set of evergreen files. Cleaned up
references so nothing points at the old monolithic core or obsolete error/
interop plans.

[playground, commands lab] 1.5h
Extended `@seqlok/playground` with Vue Router and a tabbed layout in `App.vue`,
splitting the Hotswap Lab and the new Command Ring Lab into separate routes.
Scaffolded the commands playground: `CommandRingLab`, `CommandRingConfig`,
`CommandRingVisualizer`, `CommandRingMetrics`, `CommandRingEventLog`, and the
`useCommandRingLab` composable. Wired the new components into the router and
ensured the playground builds cleanly with the expanded commands/hotswap UI.

## 2025-12-06 (6h)

[hotswap, multi-swap] 3h
Finished Level 2.5 multi-swap behavior for lanes. Locked in
**Reject-While-Busy** as the policy at the host/integration boundary:
`scheduleSwap` now returns a `SwapResult` with `accepted` and `reason`
(`"lane-busy"` vs `"invalid-ticket"`), and uses an `isLaneBusy` callback so
overlapping requests never enqueue a second ticket while a swap is in flight.
Extended the lane engine-bank harness and added an overlaps integration test
(A→B plus mid-swap B→C) to prove C never appears in decisions or audio and that
the final idle plateau matches a pure A→B swap. Left the TLA+ extension and
lane-level observability (counters / introspect surface) as explicit follow-ups
to 2.5.

[substrate, naming] 1.5h
Evicted “deck” from the Seqlok substrate in favor of **lane**. Updated core
specs, hotswap/integration harnesses, and tests so public IDs and narratives
are lane-centric while keeping DJ “deck” terminology scoped to Dekzer-level
docs. Cleaned up the duplicated mailbox/timeline drain code between the lane
timeline and engine-bank harnesses by extracting a shared helper, keeping the
hot path identical while reducing test noise.

[docs, alignment] 1.5h
Brought the hot-swap docs in line with the new behavior and naming. Updated
`HOTSWAP_INTEGRATION.md` to describe the lane-centric flow and engine-bank
application, refreshed the `hotswap-multi-swap-requirements.md` spec to mark
overlaps (2.5-O1) as PASS under Reject-While-Busy, and wired in references to
the new `lane.timeline` and `lane.engine-bank` integration tests so Level 2.5 is
backed by explicit, greppable scenarios rather than hand-wavy prose.

## 2025-12-09 (6h)

[hotswap, formal specs] 3h
Split the old monolithic hot-swap spec into two clear policies (single-swap and
reject-while-busy), with their own configs and bounded state spaces. Refined
invariants and liveness so the specs read like neutral protocol definitions,
not tutorials, and wired the TLA runner to select policies via flags while
handling extra TLC args robustly.

[hotswap, benches & integration] 2h
Added a small benchmark stack around hotswap: pure RT state machine,
reject-while-busy scheduling under mixed accept/reject load, and a short
mailbox+driver lane run. Verified the numbers are sane and align with the spec
bounds. Centralized `scheduleSwap` in the hotswap package, removed the
integration duplicate, and refreshed the lane integration tests so the
reject-while-busy contract is exercised end-to-end.

[tooling, eslint and shared config] 1h
Tightened shared Vitest and ESLint configuration across base/commands/hotswap/
integration/introspect/playground/primitives. Aligned hotswap with the shared
error-domain system, cleaned up minor lint fallout, and kept the workspace
green under tests, type checks, and the new hotswap bench command.

## 2025-12-10 → 2025-12-24 (exploratory)

[audio, worklets, mounting protocol] exploratory
Prototyped the “coprocessor runtime” concept for running engines in isolated
execution contexts (AudioWorklet / worker style), including a small mount
lifecycle and a structured message surface for readiness, errors, and logs.
Realized the initial framing was too broad and too opinionated, and carved it
down into a small, composable mounting layer instead of a “runtime”.

[naming, API surface, packaging] exploratory
Renamed the concept away from “coprocessor” toward “worklet”, standardized the
direction as `@seqlok/worklet-mount`, and locked in `mountWorkletOnPort` as the
core primitive with `mountWorkletOnNode` as a convenience wrapper. Established
the `wm:` prefix for mount protocol events and error/log codes (`wm:mount`,
`wm:ready`, `wm:error`, `wm:log`) so the integration boundary stays debuggable
and consistent across packages.

## 2025-12-25 (8h)

[spec, DSL, types] 5h
Refactored `defineSpec` from a builder-only helper into a clear spec entrypoint
with a deliberate author-time vs runtime boundary. Introduced an AST-shaped
authoring surface (`SpecAstInput`) that supports nested namespaces for `params`
and `meters`, then normalizes into a flat `SpecInput` with dot-path keys.
Rebuilt the builder types around reusable generic patterns (numeric/bool/
simple-array/enum) so literal inference stays intact while the DSL grows
without copy-paste.

[spec, normalization, validation] 2h
Implemented runtime normalization with stable invariants: flatten nested
namespaces, normalize and validate numeric scalar parameter ranges, and apply
defaults so runtime specs are consistent and planning/binding code can rely on
the shape. Aligned the output model with strict optional semantics so optional
properties behave predictably (empty maps are omitted rather than
materialized).

[tooling, lint, inference hardening] 1h
Hardened enum typing against TypeScript + ESLint sharp edges by keeping
overload-based enum builders for both params and meters. Added explicit
guidance (and lint suppression at the precise call site) to prevent “unified
signature” refactors that widen literal tuples and cascade into inference
failures and type-test breakage.
