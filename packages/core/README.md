**Seqlok**
Lock-free shared-memory sync for real-time audio, workers, and WebAssembly.

---

## Status: v0.2.0 · SWMR core + observer

Seqlok v0.2.0 ships the **single-writer, multi-reader (SWMR)** seqlock core, plus a formal observer role:

- One writer, many readers over a shared backing (`SharedArrayBuffer`).
- Controller ↔ processor bindings with coherent `within` reads and `publish` writes.
- New **observer binding** for passive / telemetry consumers on the same SWMR planes:
  - read-only `params.within(...)` and `params.snapshot(...)`,
  - read-only `meters.snapshot(...)`,
  - shared coherence/retry policy with controller/processor.
- Typed-plane layout for params (PF32 / PI32 / PB) and meters (MF32 / MU32 / MF64 / MU).
- Range-only v1 DSL: numeric scalars, fixed-length arrays, and enum / enum.array.
- **SWSR ring primitive** (`primitives/swsr-ring`) as the building block for future MWMR command buses.
- Decoupled mode only (JS + SAB); future MWMR/compose modes live in the design docs.
- Diagnostics surface (`@seqlok/core/diagnostics`) for counters, env probing, and debug tools.

**Zero-copy, seqlock-based state synchronization for real-time systems.**

A typed shared-memory layer between:

- a **Controller** (main/UI thread),
- a **Processor** (Worker / AudioWorklet),
- and optionally an **Observer** (telemetry / monitoring role),

all sharing a single backing:

- **Controller** writes **params** (what you want the engine to do).
- **Processor** writes **meters** (what the engine is actually doing).
- **Observer** reads both params/meters, but never writes.
- All readers use coherent snapshots guarded by a seqlock so no one ever sees torn state.

- **Zero allocations** – direct typed-array access over `SharedArrayBuffer`.
- **Type-safe** – full TypeScript inference from spec → plan → backing → bindings.
- **Coherent reads** – readers never observe partial writes.
- **Predictable** – deterministic memory layout, no hidden orchestration or sugar in the core.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @seqlok/core
```

### Runtime requirements

- ESM-only: modern browsers (≈2022+) or Node 20+.
- `SharedArrayBuffer` must be available:

  - **Browser**: correct COOP/COEP headers and `crossOriginIsolated === true`.
  - **Worker / AudioWorklet**: same process, SAB enabled by the host.
  - **Node**: recent Node with `SharedArrayBuffer` support (e.g. Node 20+).

## Core concept: Spec → Plan → Backing → Handoff → Bindings

Seqlok's API is shaped like the underlying protocol. There is **one golden flow** and the core does not provide
shortcuts.

1. **Spec** – what exists

   ```ts
   const spec = defineSpec(/* params + meters schema */);
   ```

2. **Plan** – how it is laid out in memory

   ```ts
   const plan = planLayout(spec);
   ```

3. **Backing** – where it lives (actual shared memory)

   ```ts
   const backing = allocateShared(plan);
   ```

4. **Handoff** – how layout + backing cross a trust boundary

   ```ts
   const handoff = buildHandoff(plan, backing);
   ```

5. **ReceivedHandoff + bindings** – how the other side sees it

   ```ts
   const received = receiveHandoff(handoff);
   const controller = bindController(spec, plan, backing);
   const processor = bindProcessor(received);
   ```

The important rule:

> `planLayout` is called exactly once at the **Spec → Plan** boundary.
> Backing and binding **consume** `Plan` — they never recompute it.

There is **no** `bindController(spec, backing)` sugar in core.
If you want shortcuts, you build them _on top_ of this flow.

## Quick sketch: controller ↔ processor

This is the minimal shape of a typical setup.

### 1. Define a spec

```ts
import { defineSpec } from "@seqlok/core";

export const deckSpec = defineSpec(({ param, meter }) => ({
  id: "deck",
  params: {
    timeRatio: param.f32({ min: 0.25, max: 4 }),
    eqBands: param.f32.array({ length: 8 }),
    mode: param.enum(["normal", "granular"]),
  },
  meters: {
    rms: meter.f32(),
    peak: meter.f32(),
    framesProcessed: meter.u32(),
  },
}));

export type DeckSpec = typeof deckSpec;
```

### 2. Owner thread: spec → plan → backing → controller + handoff

```ts
import {
  planLayout,
  allocateShared,
  buildHandoff,
  bindController,
  type Handoff,
} from "@seqlok/core";
import { deckSpec, type DeckSpec } from "./spec";

const plan = planLayout(deckSpec);
const backing = allocateShared(plan);
const controller = bindController(deckSpec, plan, backing);

const handoff: Handoff<DeckSpec> = buildHandoff(plan, backing);

// handoff is what you post to a Worker / AudioWorklet
worker.postMessage({ type: "handoff", handoff });

// Example controller usage
controller.params.set("timeRatio", 1.5);
controller.params.update({ mode: "granular" });

controller.params.stage("eqBands", (view) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < view.length; i += 1) {
    view[i] = i < 4 ? -3 : 3;
  }
});

const meters = controller.meters.snapshot("rms", "peak", "framesProcessed");
console.log(meters);
```

### 3. Worker / processor side: receive handoff → bind processor

```ts
import {
  receiveHandoff,
  bindProcessor,
  type Handoff,
  type ProcessorBinding,
} from "@seqlok/core";
import type { DeckSpec } from "./spec";

type InitMessage = {
  type: "handoff";
  handoff: Handoff<DeckSpec>;
};

let processor: ProcessorBinding<DeckSpec> | undefined;

self.onmessage = (ev: MessageEvent<InitMessage>) => {
  if (ev.data.type !== "handoff") return;

  const received = receiveHandoff(ev.data.handoff);
  processor = bindProcessor(received);
};

// Somewhere in your audio loop / worker loop
function processBlock() {
  if (!processor) return;

  processor.params.within((params) => {
    const { timeRatio, eqBands } = params;
    const framesForBlock = Math.floor(128 * timeRatio);

    processor.meters.publish((writer) => {
      writer.rms(0.5);
      writer.peak(0.9);

      writer.stage("framesProcessed", () => {
        // could be a scalar or array depending on the spec
      });

      // etc.
    });
  });
}
```

---

## Observer: passive telemetry binding

The **observer binding** is a read-only role over the same SWMR backing. It never writes params or meters; it just
samples them coherently.

### Host-side: bind from spec/plan/backing or SharedContext

```ts
import {
  bindObserver,
  type ObserverBinding,
  type Handoff,
  type ReceivedHandoff,
} from "@seqlok/core";

// Directly from spec + plan + backing
const observer: ObserverBinding<DeckSpec> = bindObserver(
  deckSpec,
  plan,
  backing,
);

// Or, if you built a SharedContext:
import { createSharedContext } from "@seqlok/core";

const ctx = createSharedContext(deckSpec);
const controller = bindController(ctx);
const observerFromCtx = bindObserver(ctx);
```

### Worker-side: bind from a received handoff

```ts
let observer: ObserverBinding<DeckSpec> | undefined;

self.onmessage = (
  ev: MessageEvent<{ type: "handoff"; handoff: Handoff<DeckSpec> }>,
) => {
  if (ev.data.type !== "handoff") return;

  const received: ReceivedHandoff<DeckSpec> = receiveHandoff(ev.data.handoff);
  observer = bindObserver(received);
};

// Periodic telemetry sampling loop
function sampleTelemetry() {
  if (!observer) return;

  const meters = observer.meters.snapshot(["rms", "peak"]);
  const params = observer.params.snapshot(["timeRatio", "mode"]);

  // Ship to logging / HUD / time-series DB, etc.
}
```

Observer uses the same seqlock-backed coherence layer as controller/processor, with configurable spin/retry budgets.

---

## Host context helper

For host-side code that reuses the same `{ spec, plan, backing }` across multiple bindings and handoffs, Seqlok exposes
a small ergonomic helper:

```ts
import {
  createSharedContext,
  bindController,
  bindObserver,
  buildHandoff,
  type SharedContext,
} from "@seqlok/core";
import { deckSpec, type DeckSpec } from "./spec";

const ctx: SharedContext<DeckSpec> = createSharedContext(deckSpec);

// Reuse the same triple everywhere
const controller = bindController(ctx);
const observer = bindObserver(ctx);
const handoff = buildHandoff(ctx);
```

This is purely a host convenience; it does not change the underlying golden flow.

---

## Benchmarks

Seqlok ships micro- and scenario-level benchmarks for both primitives (seqlock, SWSR ring) and end-to-end param/meter
flows.

Run the raw suite:

```bash
pnpm bench
```

This executes all Vitest benches with a JSON reporter and writes the raw report to:

```text
bench-results.json
```

For a human-readable summary suitable for docs:

```bash
pnpm bench:report
```

This is equivalent to:

```bash
pnpm bench && pnpm bench:format
```

- `bench` produces `bench-results.json`.
- `bench:format` (`tsx scripts/format-bench.ts`) reads `bench-results.json` and prints a Markdown-ready summary
  (ASCII charts for hot-path ops and parameter writes) to stdout, and refreshes:

  - `docs/performance/bench-results.generated.md`
  - `docs/performance/bench-results.json`

Treat these numbers as **regression guardrails**, not marketing claims.

---

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics live on a separate entry point:

```ts
import {
  snapshotCounters,
  resetCounters,
  type DiagnosticsCountersSnapshot,
} from "@seqlok/core/diagnostics";
```

Use this surface for:

- Environment probing and SAB/COOP/COEP checks.
- Binding / seqlock counters in stress harnesses.
- Dev overlays and HUDs.

It's designed so diagnostics can be tree-shaken out of production builds when unused.
