/**
 * @fileoverview
 * Health interpretation for Seqlok errors.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This module turns low-level error metadata into a small, UI-friendly
 * health description. It is intentionally:
 *
 * - **Meta-driven**: currently derives health status directly from
 *   `ErrorMeta['severity']`.
 * - **Domain-agnostic**: callers are free to wrap or override this for
 *   specific error codes (e.g. `diagnostics.*`, `backing.*`).
 *
 * The goal is to provide a stable, generic fallback that CLIs / UIs can
 * use without knowing every error code in detail.
