 * Public processor binding factory.

 * - Bridges `ReceivedHandoff` + Backing into a typed `ProcessorBinding`.
 * - For use in workers/worklets where the full spec is not available.
 * - Delegates to the low-level implementation with the plan from handoff.

 * Public processor binding.
 *
 * Use this in workers/worklets or same-thread processors where the spec

 *
 * @template S - Spec type (inferred from ReceivedHandoff<S>)
 * @param received - Validated handoff from receiveHandoff()
 * @param options - Optional processor configuration
 * @returns Typed processor binding
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Worker side:
 * import { receiveHandoff, bindProcessor } from '@seqlok/core';
 * import type { MySpec } from './spec';  // type-only import
 *
 * type InitMessage = { handoff: Handoff<MySpec> };
 *
 * self.onmessage = (ev: MessageEvent<InitMessage>) => {
 *   const received = receiveHandoff(ev.data.handoff);
 *   //    ^? ReceivedHandoff<MySpec>
 *
 *   const proc = bindProcessor(received);
 *   //    ^? ProcessorBinding<MySpec> ✓
