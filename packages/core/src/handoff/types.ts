/**
 * @fileoverview
 * Handoff type definitions.
 *
 * This module defines the public handoff envelopes used to move a planned
 * memory layout and its backing across concurrency boundaries:
 *
 * - {@link Handoff} – owner-side transport envelope (protocol-level shape).
 * - {@link AcceptedHandoff} – processor-side capability (plan + backing descriptor).
 *
 * Design principles:
 *
 * - `Plan<S>` is the single source of truth for layout and spec metadata.
 * - No duplicated header fields (hash, byte lengths, planes) outside `Plan<S>`.
 * - **Branded Types**: `Handoff<S>` uses a phantom brand to ensure that only
 *   envelopes created by `buildHandoff` can be passed to typed consumers, preventing
 *   accidental usage of raw objects.
 *
 * Binding guidance:
 * - Across a boundary (e.g. `postMessage`), consumers SHOULD validate with
 *   `acceptHandoff(...)` and bind from a `Handoff<S>` or `AcceptedHandoff<S>`.
 * - For local wiring / tests / custom hosts, binding from `SharedContext<S>` or
 *   explicit `(spec, plan, backing)` is supported by the binding layer.

 * - v1 supports:
 *   - `'shared'` – single contiguous `SharedArrayBuffer` backing all planes.
 *   - `'shared-partitioned'` – separate `SharedArrayBuffer` per plane.
 * - Future versions may introduce additional packing modes (e.g. hybrid layouts).
 * - `wasm-shared` backings are represented as `'shared'` because the envelope
 *   transports the underlying `SharedArrayBuffer` (`memory.buffer`), not the
 *   `WebAssembly.Memory` object itself.
 *
 * This value is consumed by `acceptHandoff` and interpreted by bindings;
 * it is not meant to be inspected by most application code.

 * - **Minimal**: carries only protocol bits + backing descriptor + `Plan<S>`.
 * - **Stable**: future protocol changes are versioned, not ad hoc.
 * - **Branded**: Ensures type safety when used within TypeScript environments.

 * The embedded `plan: Plan<S>` is the single source of truth for:
 *
 * - Layout metadata: `plan.hash`, `plan.bytesTotal`, `plan.planes`.
 * - Spec structure: params/meters as defined by `defineSpec`.
 * - Memory offsets and alignment: plane-relative byte layouts.

 * `buildHandoff(...)` to ensure invariants are met.

 *
 * - The processor cares only about:
 *   - the backing descriptor (`sab` or `planes`), and

 * - Protocol details like `version` are validated and then discarded by

 *
 * - Owner/orchestrator:
 *   - calls `planLayout(spec)` and `allocateShared(plan)` / `allocateSharedPartitioned(plan)`,
 *   - then builds a {@link Handoff} via `buildHandoff(...)`,
 *   - and transfers it across the boundary.
 * - Processor:
 *   - calls `acceptHandoff(handoff)` and obtains `AcceptedHandoff<S>`,
 *   - then typically binds via `bindProcessor(accepted)`.
 *
 * Binding guidance:
 * - Across a boundary, `AcceptedHandoff<S>` (or a {@link Handoff}) is the
 *   recommended capability form.
 * - For local wiring / tests / custom hosts, the binding layer may also accept
 *   `SharedContext<S>` or explicit `(spec, plan, backing)` inputs.
