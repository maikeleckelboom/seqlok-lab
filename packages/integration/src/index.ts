/**
 * RT driver for a single hotswap slot.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - Owns the `SwapStateRT` for one logical engine pair.
 * - Exposes `acceptTicket` to install a validated `SwapTicketRT`.
 * - Exposes `stepBlock` to advance the protocol each audio block and
 *   drive the hot/cold engines and crossFade according to the protocol.
 *
 * Intended to be constructed once per lane/slot on the RT side
 * (audio worklet, audio thread, or dedicated worker), then reused
 * for the lifetime of that slot.
