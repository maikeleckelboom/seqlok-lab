# Policy: `mailbox-latest`

Multi-swap semantics with **latest-wins mailbox** overlap handling.

> **EXPERIMENTAL (Level 3+)**: `mailbox-latest` is not part of the supported
> Level 1–2 taxonomy (`single`, `reject-busy`). Treat this as an experimental /
> future policy model. TLC checks for this policy are not currently considered
> “required to be green”.

If swaps are requested while the lane is busy, the host **never rejects**:
it writes the latest intent into a single-slot mailbox (overwriting any prior
pending intent). The lane converges to the last requested engine once requests
stop.
