---- MODULE HotSwapRejectBusy ----
(*
 * Formal specification of the hot-swap protocol with REJECT-WHILE-BUSY policy.
 *
 * This module extends the single-swap protocol to model multi-swap scenarios:
 *   - Sequential swaps (A→B, then B→C after completion)
 *   - Overlapping swap requests (B→C issued during A→B)
 *   - Reject-while-busy: overlapping requests are immediately rejected
 *
 * Key properties:
 *   - At most two engines active per lane
 *   - Sequential swaps complete correctly (A→B→C ends on C)
 *   - During A→B, a rejected engine C never appears in decisions
 *   - All accepted swaps eventually complete
 *
 * This models the integration layer (scheduleSwap) and RT protocol together.
